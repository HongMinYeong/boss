It always goes as I wrote
It all comes true just like my songs Can't resist Do i even exist
when I'm out of all these words
Hate when you try to
finish conversation
and hang up quickly
It's sad that I always know so I try to end quick
Do you even care how I feel 
When you asked
Do you miss them still
the friends you used to hang around
When you were ten so I said Time has passed 
I don't miss them but do you know it was all pretend
Change might seem bad in life but you know the changes aren't all bad
Nothing lasts forever at least in this world even if we don't want to admit
My friend said Don'be scared but I'm scared 
Do you miss them the friends you used to hang aroung when you were eight and of course 
I said I don't miss them I'm not sad but would never know it's all pretend 
He would never know it's all pretend
Don't want to change Losing myself is undersirable to me Can't we stay in past
Don't say you need to leave
너는 어때
내가 그때 아프게 한 거 미안해
난 여전해
우리 어렸던 동네
계속 여기 있을게
